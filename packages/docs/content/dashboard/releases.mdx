# Releases

Releases are versioned bundles of your JavaScript code that get pushed to users. Each release contains your compiled React Native bundle and can be deployed to specific channels.

## Creating a Release

To create a new release:

1. Navigate to your app in the dashboard
2. Click the **Releases** tab
3. Click **New Release** in the top right

[Screenshot: New Release Button]

### Release Form

Fill out the release details:

#### Version

Enter a version number in semantic versioning format:

- `1.0.0` - Standard version
- `2.1.0-beta.1` - Pre-release version
- `1.0.0+build.123` - Version with build metadata

The version must be unique within your app.

#### Description (Optional)

Add release notes describing what changed in this version. This is shown to users during updates and helps your team track changes.

```
- Fixed crash on profile screen
- Improved loading performance
- Added dark mode support
```

#### Channel

Select which channel to deploy to:

- **production** - Default channel for all users
- **staging** - Internal testing
- **beta** - Beta testers

[See Channels documentation](/dashboard/channels) for setting up additional channels.

#### Mandatory Update

Toggle this option to force users to update before using the app.

**Use sparingly** - Mandatory updates interrupt the user experience. Reserve them for:

- Critical security fixes
- Breaking API changes
- Features that require server-side updates

### Uploading Your Bundle

After filling out the form:

1. Drag and drop your `.jsbundle` file, or click to browse
2. Wait for the upload to complete
3. Click **Create Release**

The bundle will be processed and verified before becoming available.

## Release States

Each release has a status that indicates its current state:

### Processing

The release is being verified and prepared for distribution.

- Bundle integrity is checked
- Signature is verified
- Metadata is extracted

Releases typically process in under a minute.

### Active

The release is live and being distributed to devices based on:

- Channel assignment
- Rollout percentage
- Targeting rules

Active releases show green status badges in the dashboard.

### Disabled

The release has been manually disabled and won't be distributed to any devices.

Common reasons to disable:

- Bug discovered after deployment
- Temporary pause for investigation
- Superseded by newer version

Disabled releases show a yellow status badge.

## Staged Rollouts

Staged rollouts let you gradually deploy updates to a percentage of users, reducing risk.

### How Rollout Percentage Works

When you set a rollout percentage:

- `10%` - Only 10% of eligible devices receive the update
- `50%` - Half of eligible devices receive the update
- `100%` - All eligible devices receive the update (full rollout)

Devices are assigned consistently, so the same device will always be in or out of the rollout group until you change the percentage.

### Adjusting Rollout

To change the rollout percentage:

1. Go to your release's detail page
2. Find the **Rollout** section
3. Use the slider or enter a value directly
4. Use the preset buttons (10%, 25%, 50%, 100%) for common values

### Rollout Best Practices

1. **Start small** - Begin with 10% to catch issues early
2. **Monitor metrics** - Watch error rates before expanding
3. **Expand gradually** - Move to 25%, then 50%, then 100%
4. **Be ready to pause** - If problems arise, set to 0%

## Release Notes

Release notes help users understand what's new and help your team track changes.

### Writing Good Release Notes

- Keep them concise but informative
- Use bullet points for multiple changes
- Highlight breaking changes prominently
- Include relevant ticket or PR numbers

### Updating Release Notes

To update notes after creation:

1. Click on the release to open its detail page
2. Click the **Edit** button
3. Update the description field
4. Click **Save**

---

## Viewing Metrics

Each release has detailed metrics showing its performance:

[Screenshot: Release Stats]

### Adoption Rate

The percentage of eligible devices now running this release. Calculated as:

```
(Devices on this release / Total eligible devices) x 100
```

A healthy release should see steady adoption growth.

### Total Downloads

The number of times this release bundle has been downloaded. Multiple downloads from the same device (e.g., after app reinstall) are counted separately.

### Active Devices

The number of unique devices currently running this release and actively checking for updates.

### Error Rate

The percentage of downloads that resulted in errors:

- Download failures
- Verification failures
- Apply failures

A healthy release should have an error rate under 1%.

### Understanding the Metrics

| Metric | Good | Warning | Investigate |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| Adoption | Steady growth | Slow uptake | Declining |
| Error Rate | < 1% | 1-5% | > 5% |

## Rollback from Dashboard

If a release causes problems, you can rollback from the dashboard.

### Triggering a Rollback

1. Go to the problematic release's detail page
2. Click the **more options** menu (three dots)
3. Select **Rollback**
4. Confirm in the dialog

[Screenshot: Rollback Confirmation Dialog]

### What Happens During Rollback

1. The current release is disabled
2. Devices check for updates on their next sync
3. They receive the previous active release
4. Metrics are logged for the rollback event

### Automatic vs Manual Rollback

BundleNudge supports two types of rollback:

**Automatic Rollback** - The SDK detects crashes within seconds of applying an update and automatically reverts to the previous version. Configure this in [Health Settings](/dashboard/apps#health-configuration).

**Manual Rollback** - You trigger a rollback from the dashboard when you notice issues through metrics or user reports.

## Managing Releases

### Enabling/Disabling Releases

To temporarily disable a release:

1. Find the release in the list or detail page
2. Click the **power icon** to toggle status
3. Or use the dropdown menu and select **Disable**

Disabled releases remain in your history but aren't distributed.

### Deleting Releases

To permanently delete a release:

1. Open the release detail page
2. Click the dropdown menu
3. Select **Delete**
4. Confirm in the dialog

**Warning**: Deleted releases cannot be recovered. Devices running deleted releases will receive the next available version on their next update check.
