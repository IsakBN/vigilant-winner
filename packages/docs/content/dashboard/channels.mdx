# Channels

Channels let you deploy different versions of your app to different groups of users. They're essential for staged rollouts, beta testing, and environment separation.

## What Are Channels?

A channel is a deployment track that determines which release a device receives. Each device subscribes to a single channel and receives the active release for that channel.

Common channel patterns:

| Channel | Purpose | Users |
|---------|---------|-------|
| production | Stable releases | All users (default) |
| staging | Internal testing | Your team |
| beta | Beta program | Opt-in testers |
| canary | Early testing | Small % of users |

---

## The Default Channel (Production)

Every app comes with a **production** channel that cannot be deleted. This channel:

- Is assigned to devices by default
- Receives releases intended for all users
- Has 100% rollout by default
- Is marked with a "Default" badge in the UI

[Screenshot: Channel List with Default Badge]

When a device initializes the SDK without specifying a channel, it automatically subscribes to production.

```typescript
// Device subscribes to production channel by default
BundleNudge.init({
  appId: 'app_abc123',
  apiKey: 'bnk_xxx',
  // channel: 'production' (implicit)
});
```

## Creating Channels

To create a new channel:

1. Go to your app in the dashboard
2. Click the **Channels** tab
3. Click **New Channel**

[Screenshot: Create Channel Form]

### Channel Configuration

#### Name

Choose a URL-safe identifier (lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens):

- `staging`
- `beta`
- `internal-testing`
- `canary-v2`

This is the value you'll use in the SDK configuration.

#### Display Name

A human-readable name shown in the dashboard:

- "Staging Environment"
- "Beta Testers"
- "Internal QA"

#### Description (Optional)

Explain the channel's purpose:

```
Beta channel for users who opted into early access
through the settings screen.
```

Click **Create Channel** when done.

## Common Channel Setups

### Staging Channel

For internal testing before production:

1. Create a channel named `staging`
2. Deploy new releases to staging first
3. Have your team test thoroughly
4. Promote to production when ready

```typescript
// In your staging build
BundleNudge.init({
  appId: 'app_abc123',
  apiKey: 'bnk_xxx',
  channel: 'staging',
});
```

### Beta Channel

For beta testers and early adopters:

1. Create a channel named `beta`
2. Add a beta opt-in toggle in your app settings
3. Switch channel based on user preference

```typescript
// Dynamic channel based on user preference
const channel = user.isBetaTester ? 'beta' : 'production';

BundleNudge.init({
  appId: 'app_abc123',
  apiKey: 'bnk_xxx',
  channel,
});
```

### Environment-Based Channels

Match channels to your environments:

```typescript
// Based on build configuration
const channel = __DEV__ ? 'development' : 'production';

BundleNudge.init({
  appId: 'app_abc123',
  apiKey: 'bnk_xxx',
  channel,
});
```

## Promoting Between Channels

Promoting means deploying a release from one channel to another. This is the safest way to move code from staging to production.

### Manual Promotion

1. Go to the release you want to promote
2. Click **Promote** or select it from the dropdown menu
3. Choose the target channel
4. Confirm the promotion

[Screenshot: Promote Release Dialog]

### Promotion Best Practices

1. **Staging first** - Always test in staging before production
2. **Gradual rollout** - Start with low percentage in production
3. **Monitor metrics** - Watch for issues after each promotion
4. **Document changes** - Update release notes if needed

### Promotion Flow Example

```
Developer pushes code
    ↓
Release created on 'staging' channel
    ↓
QA tests on staging (100% rollout)
    ↓
Promote to 'beta' channel
    ↓
Beta testers validate (100% rollout)
    ↓
Promote to 'production' channel
    ↓
Gradual rollout: 10% → 25% → 50% → 100%
```

## Device Targeting

Device targeting lets you control which devices within a channel receive updates based on device attributes.

### Setting Up Targeting Rules

1. Go to your channel's detail page
2. Find the **Targeting Rules** section
3. Click **Add Rule**

[Screenshot: Targeting Rules Builder]

### Available Target Fields

| Field | Description | Example Value |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| `appVersion` | App's semantic version | `1.2.0` |
| `osVersion` | Device OS version | `17.0`, `14` |
| `platform` | Device platform | `ios`, `android` |
| `deviceModel` | Device model identifier | `iPhone15,2` |
| `locale` | Device locale | `en-US`, `de-DE` |
| `timezone` | Device timezone | `America/New_York` |

### Available Operators

| Operator | Description | Use With |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `equals` | Exact match | Any field |
| `not equals` | Excludes value | Any field |
| `greater than` | Numeric comparison | Versions, numbers |
| `greater or equal` | Numeric comparison | Versions, numbers |
| `less than` | Numeric comparison | Versions, numbers |
| `less or equal` | Numeric comparison | Versions, numbers |
| `version >` | Semantic version comparison | appVersion, osVersion |
| `version >=` | Semantic version comparison | appVersion, osVersion |
| `version <` | Semantic version comparison | appVersion, osVersion |
| `version <=` | Semantic version comparison | appVersion, osVersion |
| `contains` | Substring match | Any text field |
| `starts with` | Prefix match | Any text field |

### Match Logic

When you have multiple rules, choose how they combine:

- **Match All** - Device must satisfy every rule (AND logic)
- **Match Any** - Device must satisfy at least one rule (OR logic)

### Targeting Examples

**Only devices on iOS 17 or later:**

```
osVersion  version >=  17.0
```

**Only devices in the US:**

```
locale  starts with  en-US
```

**Exclude old app versions:**

```
appVersion  version >=  2.0.0
```

**Multiple conditions (Match All):**

```
platform     equals      ios
osVersion    version >=  16.0
appVersion   version >=  1.5.0
```

### Removing Targeting

To remove a targeting rule:

1. Click the **trash icon** next to the rule
2. The rule is removed immediately

To target all devices, remove all rules. The message "No targeting rules. All devices will receive updates." confirms universal targeting.

## Channel Settings

### Editing a Channel

1. Click on the channel to open its detail page
2. Click **Edit Channel** or the settings icon
3. Update the display name or description
4. Click **Save**

### Rollout Percentage

Control what percentage of targeted devices receive updates:

1. Go to the channel detail page
2. Find the **Rollout Percentage** slider
3. Adjust using the slider or enter a value
4. Use presets: 10%, 25%, 50%, 100%

[Screenshot: Rollout Slider Component]

**Rollout states:**

- `0%` - Paused, no devices receive updates
- `1-99%` - Gradual rollout in progress
- `100%` - Full rollout to all targeted devices

### Deleting a Channel

Non-default channels can be deleted:

1. Go to the channel detail page
2. Click **Delete Channel**
3. Confirm deletion

**Warning**: Devices subscribed to a deleted channel will stop receiving updates. Consider migrating them to another channel first by pushing a release that changes the channel subscription.
