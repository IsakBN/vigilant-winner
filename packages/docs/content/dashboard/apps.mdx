# Managing Apps

Apps are the foundation of BundleNudge. Each app you create corresponds to a React Native application that will receive over-the-air updates.

## Creating an App

To create your first app:

1. Navigate to your dashboard at `dashboard.bundlenudge.com`
2. Click the **Create App** button in the top right corner
3. In the modal that appears, you'll need to provide:

### Platform Selection

Choose the platform for your app:

- **iOS** - For iPhone and iPad apps
- **Android** - For Android devices

You'll create separate apps for each platform, even if they share the same codebase.

### App Name

Enter a descriptive name for your app (e.g., "My Awesome App - iOS"). This name is for your reference in the dashboard and won't be visible to end users.

- Maximum 100 characters
- Choose something that helps you identify the app at a glance

### Bundle ID (Optional)

Enter your app's bundle identifier:

- **iOS**: Your Bundle Identifier (e.g., `com.company.myapp`)
- **Android**: Your Application ID (e.g., `com.company.myapp`)

This should match the identifier in your app's native configuration. While optional during creation, providing it helps with verification and organization.

Click **Create App** to finish. You'll be taken to the setup page with instructions for integrating the SDK.

## App Settings

To access settings for an existing app:

1. Go to your dashboard
2. Click on the app you want to configure
3. Click the **Settings** tab in the app navigation

### General Settings

The general settings section lets you update:

- **App Name** - Rename your app
- **Bundle ID** - Add or update the bundle identifier
- **Platform** - View the platform (cannot be changed after creation)

### Health Configuration

Health checks help BundleNudge automatically detect and rollback problematic updates. Configure:

#### Critical Events

Events that must fire within a timeout after app start to consider the update healthy.

1. Click **Add Event** in the Critical Events section
2. Enter an event name (e.g., `app_ready`, `user_authenticated`)
3. Set the timeout in seconds (default: 30)
4. Toggle **Required** if this event must fire

#### Critical Endpoints

API endpoints that are checked after your app reports ready.

1. Click **Add Endpoint** in the Critical Endpoints section
2. Select the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
3. Enter the URL to check
4. Specify expected status codes (e.g., `200, 201`)
5. Toggle **Required** if this endpoint must succeed

Click **Save Configuration** when done.

## API Keys

API keys authenticate your React Native app with BundleNudge servers.

### Generating an API Key

If you haven't generated a key yet:

1. Go to your app's **Settings** tab
2. Find the **API Key** section
3. Click **Generate API Key**

Your new key will be displayed. Copy it immediately and store it securely.

### Viewing Your API Key

By default, your API key is masked for security. To reveal it:

1. Click the **eye icon** next to the masked key
2. The full key will be displayed
3. Click the eye icon again to hide it

### Copying Your API Key

Click the **Copy** button to copy the API key to your clipboard.

### Regenerating an API Key

If your key is compromised or you need a fresh one:

1. Click the **Regenerate** button
2. Confirm in the dialog that appears
3. Your old key will be invalidated immediately

**Warning**: Any apps using the old key will stop receiving updates until you update them with the new key.

### Security Best Practices

- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- Use environment variables in your app
- Regenerate keys if they may have been exposed
- Keep keys secret from public repositories

## Deleting an App

Only the account owner can delete apps. This action is permanent.

To delete an app:

1. Go to the app's **Settings** tab
2. Scroll to the **Danger Zone** section at the bottom
3. Click **Delete App**
4. Type the app name to confirm
5. Click **Delete Permanently**

[Screenshot: Delete App Confirmation]

**What happens when you delete an app:**

- All releases are permanently deleted
- All channels are removed
- Historical metrics are lost
- Devices will no longer receive updates
- The app ID becomes unavailable

Consider disabling the app or archiving releases instead if you might need the data later.

## Next Steps

Once your app is created:

1. [Install the SDK](/sdk/installation) in your React Native project
2. [Create your first release](/dashboard/releases) to push an update
3. [Set up channels](/dashboard/channels) for staged rollouts
