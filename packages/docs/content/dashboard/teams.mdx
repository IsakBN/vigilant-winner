## Roles: Owner, Admin, Member

BundleNudge has three roles with different permission levels:

### Owner

The account owner has full control:

| Capability | Owner |
|------------|-------|
| View apps and releases | Yes |
| Create apps | Yes |
| Delete apps | **Yes** |
| Create releases | Yes |
| Manage channels | Yes |
| Invite members | Yes |
| Remove members | Yes |
| Change member roles | Yes |
| Access billing | **Yes** |
| Delete account | **Yes** |

There is exactly one owner per account. Ownership cannot be transferred.

### Admin

Admins can manage most aspects of the account:

| Capability | Admin |
|------------|-------|
| View apps and releases | Yes |
| Create apps | Yes |
| Delete apps | No |
| Create releases | Yes |
| Manage channels | Yes |
| Invite members | Yes |
| Remove members | Yes (except owner) |
| Change member roles | Yes (except owner) |
| Access billing | View only |
| Delete account | No |

Admins are ideal for team leads and senior developers.

### Member

Members have limited capabilities focused on day-to-day work:

| Capability | Member |
|------------|--------|
| View apps and releases | Yes |
| Create apps | No |
| Delete apps | No |
| Create releases | Yes |
| Manage channels | View only |
| Invite members | No |
| Remove members | No |
| Change member roles | No |
| Access billing | No |
| Delete account | No |

Members are ideal for developers who need to deploy updates.

### Role Comparison

| Capability | Owner | Admin | Member |
|------------|-------|-------|--------|
| View apps | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## Per-Project Access

You can grant team members access to specific apps instead of the entire account.

### Setting Up Project Access

1. Go to your team's **Members** tab
2. Click on a member to view their details
3. Find the **App Access** section
4. Toggle access for individual apps

[Screenshot: Per-Project Access Settings]

### Access Levels

- **All Apps** - Member can access every app in the account
- **Specific Apps** - Member only sees selected apps

Members with limited access will only see their assigned apps in the dashboard sidebar and cannot discover other apps.

### Use Cases

**Contractor Access:**

Give contractors access only to the project they're working on:

1. Invite with "Member" role
2. Limit to the specific app
3. Remove when project completes

**Department Separation:**

Keep marketing apps separate from engineering apps:

1. Create separate app groups
2. Assign team members to their relevant apps
3. Prevent accidental deployments to the wrong app

## Removing Members

Admins and owners can remove team members.

### How to Remove a Member

1. Go to your team's **Members** tab
2. Find the member in the list
3. Click the **Remove** button
4. Confirm the removal

[Screenshot: Member Table with Remove Button]

### What Happens When Removed

- Member loses access immediately
- Any pending work is preserved
- Historical activity logs remain
- Member can be re-invited later

### Restrictions

- You cannot remove the account owner
- You cannot remove yourself
- Admins cannot remove other admins (only the owner can)

---

## Billing and Subscriptions

Billing is managed at the account level by the owner.

### Viewing Your Plan

1. Go to **Settings** in the sidebar
2. Click **Billing**
3. View your current plan and usage

[Screenshot: Billing Page]

### Plan Details

Your plan determines:

- Number of apps you can create
- Monthly active devices limit
- Number of team members
- Support level

### Subscription Management

The account owner can:

1. **Upgrade** - Move to a higher tier
2. **Downgrade** - Move to a lower tier (at period end)
3. **Cancel** - End subscription (keeps data until period end)
4. **Update payment** - Change credit card

### Viewing Invoices

1. Go to **Settings** > **Billing**
2. Click **Invoices**
3. View or download past invoices

### Usage Tracking

Monitor your usage against plan limits:

- **Active Devices** - Unique devices checking for updates
- **Team Members** - Current member count vs. limit
- **Apps** - Number of apps vs. limit

Usage resets monthly on your billing date.

## Team Settings

### Changing Member Roles

To change a member's role:

1. Go to the **Members** tab
2. Find the member in the table
3. Click the role dropdown (shows current role)
4. Select the new role

[Screenshot: Role Selector Dropdown]

Changes take effect immediately. The member's permissions update on their next page load.

### Role Change Restrictions

- Only owners can change admin roles
- You cannot change your own role
- You cannot change the owner's role

---

## Best Practices

### Team Structure

Recommended role distribution:

- **1 Owner** - Account creator, manages billing
- **2-3 Admins** - Team leads, manage releases and members
- **Unlimited Members** - Developers, deploy updates

### Security

1. **Use SSO** if available on your plan
2. **Audit regularly** - Review member list quarterly
3. **Limit admins** - Only give admin to those who need it
4. **Remove promptly** - Revoke access when people leave

### Collaboration

1. **Document channels** - Explain what each channel is for
2. **Coordinate deployments** - Avoid conflicts with communication
3. **Use release notes** - Help team members understand changes
