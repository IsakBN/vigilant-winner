## Critical Path

1. ✅ Phase 0-5 features (24 features) - DONE
2. ✅ Wave 1-3 Remediation - DONE
3. ✅ Wave 4: Feature Completion - DONE
4. ✅ **Wave 5: Admin System** - DONE
5. 🔄 **Wave 6: Build System** ← NEXT
6. ⏳ Wave 7: Dashboard + SDK

## Lessons Learned (Updated)

1. **Use hierarchical agents** - PM → Coordinators → Executors → Auditors
2. **Always run auditors** - Security, Performance, Integration after each wave
3. **GO/NO-GO gates** - Don't proceed without passing audits
4. **Quality over speed** - Better to fix early than debug in production
5. **Document agent work** - Track who built what with `@agent` attribution
6. **Semantic understanding** - Know WHAT we're building, not just HOW
7. **Resource management** - Run tests sequentially on limited RAM machines
8. **Fix lint/type errors immediately** - Don't let them accumulate
